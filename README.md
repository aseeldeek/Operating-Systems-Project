# Operating-Systems-Project
This project is about a page replacement simulator that schedules the processes
according to the Round Robin algorithm and after that, these processes go throw
two-page replacement algorithms ( FIFO and LRU) algorithms to calculate the page
fault for each process, the total page fault, and the total cycles without using threads.
Also, an interface was designed to show the output in a nice way.
